## How to visualize

open test.html in a browser to view the set of surfaces associated with the Faisman-SAP2013.pdf

## How to generate a set of surfaces

I recommend using Mozilla Firefox for this step

1. Navigate to Settings
2. Search for Downloads in the Settings search bar
3. Choose the folder in which you wish to save all the generated images. I recommend a dedicated folder for each new set.
4. Uncheck the "Always ask you where to save files" setting.
5. Open gensurfaces.html (this will take a few minutes to complete and Firefox will warn you that the webpage is struggling, ignore the warning and wait)
